As a passionate technology enthusiast, my interest in coding have shaped me since a very young age. Starting with Basic on my first PC computer, learning programming languages as HTML; CSS; C++; Turbo Pascal and Assembler in upper secondary school. Continuing to learn other languages as GdScript, C# and more; on my own. 
Iâ€™m constantly striving for professional growth, learning new technologies, and adapting to rapidly changing technical conditions as I am a firm believer in the power of continual learning.
